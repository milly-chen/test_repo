      <description>Learning about data wrangling was tough enough this semester, but throw in some python and now my head is really spinning. During the last few lectures, the most surprising thing was that you can actually code python in RStudio! This can be done by creating python code chunks.
First ensure the “reticulate” package has been installed and now let’s try some python coding! Fingers crossed! Hopefully it works.</description>

      <description>The two datasets I chose are about the happiness index of countries (2019) and the average alcohol servings of countries. I got this dataset from kaggle and the world happiness report. The happiness_index dataset includes countries, their rank in happiness, the happiness score, GPD per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. These variables were calculated by surverying citizens of each country on each statistic and using a complex formula to calculate the score of happiness index to get the rank of each country.</description>
